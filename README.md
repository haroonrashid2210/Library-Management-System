## About

This Library Management System is a robust C++ application that leverages various data structures for efficient organization and retrieval of library resources.

## Data Structures Utilized

- Queues
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Linked List
- Hashing

## Description

1. To establish a systematic way of assigning unique book IDs, an algorithm employing queues has been implemented. This ensures the generation of distinct IDs based on book names.

2. Hashing is employed using a 2D array with dimensions 10 x 5 (10 rows and 5 columns) of BST. Each column represents a rack, with indexes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 corresponding to Mathematics, Computer Science, and other categories. This structured approach facilitates efficient categorization and retrieval of books.

3. Each node in the Binary Search Tree contains a linked list, contributing to a well-organized and easily navigable data structure.
