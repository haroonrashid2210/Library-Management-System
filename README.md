Our project is a library management system developed in C++ using data structures.

<b>Data Structures Used</b><br>
•	Queues<br>
•	BST<br>
•	Linked List<br>
•	Hashing

<b>Description</b><br> 
1.  As we have to know some type of ID (numbers) to store data in BST. So we generated book IDs using book names. In that algorithm we used queues. 
2.	We have used hashing using a 2D array of 10 x 5 (10 rows and 5 columns) of BST. The 5 columns are the racks. The columns are Mathematics, Computer Science, Islamiat and others at indexes 0,1,2,3 and 4 respectively.
3.	So basically our every node in BST contains a linked list.

<b>Running Instruction</b><br>
As our project is getting the data from a text file. So, the directory must be changed in the code at line no 610. Datafile.txt is included in the zip file.
